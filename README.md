# Assessment 1 - Achieved 19/20 (High Distinction)
Applying what we learned and implementing robotics and kinematics algorithms to control a simulated and physical robot arm.
## **Task** 
The task is to demonstrate typing a word on the keyboard in CoppeliaSim:
- The word can be chosen by you and must be 5 letters long.
- The case of the word does not matter, you only need to type the letter keys A-Z.
- Demonstrate your robot performing this simulation to one of your prac tutors during a prac session. (3 marks)
- Show and describe to your sessional academic the key elements of your solution code: transformation of points, handling key positions, and inverse kinematics. You have to do this in one of the practical sessions. (2 marks)

# Assessment 2 - Achieved 9/10 (High Distinction)
Applying what we learned and implementing computer vision algorithms for a robotics application.
## **Task**
The task is to demonstrate a pick-and-place task in CoppeliaSim. There are 5 objects in the scene that you will need to detect, and then move to a new location. More specifically:

- The initial positions of the objects can be chosen by you.
- The target position of each object can be chosen by you, but each object must move at least 75mm.
- You may choose the parameters for warping the image.
- Demonstrate your robot performing this simulation to one of your prac tutors during a prac session. (1.5 marks)
- Show and describe to your sessional academic the key elements of your solution code: locating objects within the image (2 marks), calculating a homography (3.5 marks), locating the objects within the workspace (2 marks), and moving the objects (1 mark). You have to do this in one of the practical sessions.
